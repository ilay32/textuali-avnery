kolimilim-avnery
================

Minimal "book" to experiment with features for kolmilim flipbook etc.

Note that `css/responsive.css` is not really responsive.
It's a modified copy of `basic.css` with the *intention* of one day becoming responsive ;)

#### Note (true for all kolmilim projects)

Some files are not part of the repository. It is assumed that this folder is being served so that

* `../scans/avnery/` is where we put the scans (too large to manage in a repo)
* `../vendor/turnjs4` contains what it should (license [probably] doesn't allow putting it in a repo)
